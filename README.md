# Patient-Monitoring

#Title:
Treatment monitoring and Patient Monitoring Web App

#Description:
For most of the hospitals, when a patient visits it for treatment a file is prepared by filling in his/her illness details. The patient has to carry that file everywhere he goes and that file is also handled by nurses and/or doctors dealing with that patient. Nowadays due to covid, it is not safe that file is carried around and it is handled by many people.

So here comes our web-based solution for the problem - 
We will be creating a web-based database system where treatment monitoring and updation of Kidney Patients, Cancer Patients and People with Palliative Care Needs can be done.

At the time of registration authorized person can register a patient on the web app and that authorized person will give a unique id to the patient. With that id, patient and sections of hospitals which require the details of the patient would be able to view the details from anywhere through a web app. Only authorized doctors can view information of all the patients and update treatment information regarding their particular patient.

Options to filter patients based on the type of disease will also be there and the authorized doctor can decide treatment based on the severity of illness. After the patient is recovered he/she can be removed from the list of ill patients. Also extra functionality to print the patient treatment details can be added.
